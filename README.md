A Bukkit server plugin that lets allowed users be invisible to other players when in sneak mode.

This mod enables users with permission ninja.basic to be invisible to all other users of the server, when sneaking (default shift).

It is designed to prevent invisible players from killing others relentlessly/outside of the victim's power. Because of this, you cannot be invisible when flying or in the air. (I feel as though the in-the-air part contributes to the ninja element)

This makes killing people without them seeing you and being able to defend themselves impossible because you have to move very slowly, cannot jump, and cannot fly speedily around them.

Commands
===============

/ninja enables the ability

/normal disables the ability (you can sneak like normal)
